A proof-of-concept Discord "FTP"-like storage.

-- I tried my best --

##### What's with that project?
Well... During the development of this project, which started as a joke itself, I (Proxymiity) took a warning reminding me about the existence of the Discord ToS. I am currently waiting for Discord's support to reply to my ticket, but I don't think this project is viable in terms of.. whatever.  
This project should have had an encryption system for uploaded files, but doesn't due to the fact that I'm not even sure if it will be able to even exist.

##### The initial concept?
Being able to upload files to Discord using a bot from your PC, retrieve them to your PC with that same bot. Also, download files from the Internet directly to Discord.

##### What if I run it?
You'll get banned.
